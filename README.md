<!--Goal and purpose of this project -->
## About this project  
This project is part of the Wild Codes Schools curriculum of becoming a junior full-stack developer. The purpose of this project is to train coding skills in the front- and backend. Whereas the frontend is build with REACT using many different libraries, the backend is linked to an online mysql database which has been deployed on heroku. 

The app itself has been built for banking customers, who want to safely log into their **Smart Account** and view their banking data such as transactions, spending patterns,  digital channel use, etc.
